    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide and end-to-end description of the treatment effect estimation process. This notebook consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data processing**: The first part is the data processing part. Here we basically prepare the data for the ML models.\n",
    "2. **Causal ML Models**: The second part of the notebook consists of a series of causal ML learning models. In particular, we use the causal meta-learning framework. \n",
    "3. **Adadptive Model**: The third part of the notebook is also a machine learning model. However, contrary to the models before, this one was developed by the VU team and allows for more control over the estimation proces. \n",

    "\n",
    "We first want to get some preliminaries out of the way. In particular, we would like to make some specific **design choices** explicit. Below, we can set the following parameters, thereby modifying specific choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``EXPOSURE_THRESHOLD``: The treatment is binary. However, how much treatment is provided can be changed with this variable. In essence, it determines the cut-off value. For instance, we can set it to 60 minutes in the case of physical therapy (in mins.). Then, patients with more then 60 minutes of PT will be assigned T=1, those below will be T=0.\n",
    "- ``PERIOD_MIN``: Minimal time period between baseline measurement and followup measurement. N.B. If this is set too low, the effect may not yet register. Too high and the effect may have faded out. \n",
    "- ``PERIOD_MAX``: Maximal time period between baseline measurement and followup measurement. N.B. If this is set too low, effect may not yet register. Too high and the effect may have faded out.  \n",
    "- ``REMOVE_MULTI_COL``: Whether or not to remove multicollinear columns. \n",
    "- ``CORRELATION_THRESHOLD``: Threshold for removing collinear columns. \n",
    "- ``UNDERSAMPLE``: Some models perform better when undersampling the minority class. For instance, if there are 1000 cases of patients with PT (T=0) and only 150 with PT (T=1), setting this to ``True`` ensures that 150 patients are sampled from PT (T=0), resulting in 300 observations in total.\n",
    "- ``IMPUTE``: Whether or not to impute missing *covariate* values.\n",
    "- ``PROPENSITY``: Whether or not to add a propensity score to the model.\n",
    "- ``CLEAN_COMPARE``: By default (when this is set to ``False``), the data processing script assigns any observations below ``EXPOSURE_THRESHOLD`` to the control group and  any observation above ``EXPOSURE_THRESHOLD`` to treated. Setting this parameter to ``True`` creates a scenario where *only* observation that did not get any treatment are assigned to the control group. For instance, in the case of PT, we would have a control group of patients getting only 0 mins. of PT and a treated group of patients with, say, more than 60 mins. of PT.\n",
    "- ``TREATMENT``: Name of the treatment variable.\n",
    "- ``TARGET``: Name of the target variable."
